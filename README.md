# LearnChess: AI Tutor

LearnChess: AI Tutor is a chess learning application designed to help users improve their chess skills using AI. The app evaluates board positions and suggests optimal moves, providing an interactive way to learn strategy, tactics, and decision-making in chess.

This project was my Computer Science A-Level NEA (Non-Exam Assessment). It allowed me to apply advanced algorithmic concepts and object-oriented programming in a practical application, demonstrating both my coding skills and understanding of AI principles.

## Features

- Play chess against an AI powered by a **minimax algorithm**  
- Analyze board positions and receive move suggestions to improve strategy  
- Track and review moves to understand tactical decisions  
- Interactive learning experience that adapts to the playerâ€™s skill level

## Motivation

I chose to create LearnChess: AI Tutor as my NEA project because I wanted to combine **my interest in algorithms and AI** with a practical application that I could both use and showcase. Chess is a game of strategy and pattern recognition, making it a perfect domain to implement and demonstrate algorithmic thinking.
